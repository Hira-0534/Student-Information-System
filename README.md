ðŸŽ“ Student Information System (DSA Project)

This is my Data Structures and Algorithms project, created using C++.
It is a Student Information System that helps in storing student records, managing their data, and performing different operations using ADT Array and Linked List.

The project demonstrates how data structures can be applied to build real-world applications for academic record management.

ðŸš€ Features

Student record management (Roll No, Name, Course Code, Marks, CGPA)

Array (Vector) based operations

Linked List based operations

Insertion, searching, updating, and deletion of records

Searching by Course Code, CGPA, and Marks

Sorting student records using Bubble Sort

Ensures unique roll numbers

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project contains the following files and folders:

1. src/student_system.cpp

Main C++ source code

Implements CRUD, searching, and sorting operations

2. report/DSA_Report.pdf

Project report with detailed explanation


ðŸ“Š CRUD Operations

This project supports the four fundamental operations of data management:

Create â†’ Add a new student record

Read â†’ Display/search existing records

Update â†’ Modify student details

Delete â†’ Remove student records

ðŸ’» Technologies Used

C++ Programming Language

Data Structures: Array (Vector), Singly Linked List

Algorithms: Linear Search, Bubble Sort

ðŸ“š What I Learned

How to implement abstract data types (ADT)

Practical use of Linked Lists for insertion and deletion

Implementing searching and sorting algorithms

Applying CRUD operations in a real-world academic system

Structuring projects for academic and professional presentation.
